## SASS Inspector


SASS Inspector is an Chrome Extension that helps you inspect elements with file name and line numbers

## Some minor bugs

This extension have some bugs. I have tested it on 3 websites with a lot of SASS code and all of them work perfectly. But still some users have some problems enabling this extension. Please submit tickets and if you can upload the CSS file that is not working. I think it is the best way to debug it.
